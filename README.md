The project was undertaken while following the Youtube Tutorial on this site : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWv2jnhZErc&t=1691s
The webpage is a digital clock project with a simple structure. It includes HTML for content and structure, CSS for styling,
and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The displayed digital clock consists of sections for hours, minutes, seconds, and an AM/PM indicator.
The styling is defined in the linked "style.css" file, and the dynamic behavior is handled by the "index.js" script.
